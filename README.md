# LaneDetection

Works well for images and videos in a straight line. Work still in progress for detecting curved lines in real time.

The `filevideostream.py` is class that i've used to improve fps rate of processing frames and read video files. I've implemeted this using
**queue data structure** and **threading**.

Use `--image [pathname]` for lane detection in image and `--video [pathname]` for  detection in video.
